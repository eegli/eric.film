## FAQ

> Your Google Analytics tracking id, Sentry DSN and GraphQL endpoint are all public. Would it make sense to put them into `env.local`?

Not really. GA tracking ids are public anyway since they can be found when checking out any webpage's source code.
With Sentury - or more specifically `@sentry/browser` - it is the same. It cannot be hidden in the frontend.

This is why it is good practice to filter requests by hostname / allowed domains - something that is possible for both Sentury and Google Analytics.

My GraphQL endpoint needs to be public since the frontend has the possibility to fetch more blog posts directly from my backend. Thus, requests to GraphCMS can also be inspected any browser's dev tools.
