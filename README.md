# eric.film

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Feel free to copy/paste stuff from this repository and use it in your own project! Also, feedback is greatly appreciated.

## Roadmap

- Better image handling
- SEO improvements
- Search posts
- Browser push
- Display warning for unsupported browsers
- Nginx proxy to bypass adblockers for Google Analytics
- Add more tests 👻

## FAQ

> Your Google Analytics tracking id, Sentry DSN and GraphQL endpoint are all public. Would it make sense to put them into `env.local`?

GA tracking ids are public anyway since they can be found when checking out any webpage's HTML head.
With Sentury - or more specifically `@sentry/browser` - it is the same. It cannot be hidden in the frontend.

This is why it is good practice to filter requests by hostname / allowed domains - something that is possiby<sxcd vbnymc,v.basy<XDFGHJKLale for both Sentury and Google Analytics.

My GraphQL endpoint needs to be public since the frontend has the possibility to fetch more blog posts directly from my backend. It does, however, not allow mutations ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

> Something's wrong or could be improved

Good point, there are plenty of things that still need some work. This website is a living project and will receive updates and new features depending on how much time I can invest. If you see a quick win or something that is done utterly badly, I'm more than happy to receive feedback on my social channels or via PR!
